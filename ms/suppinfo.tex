% OVERVIEW
%
% Please note that all supporting information will be peer reviewed with your manuscript.
% In general, the purpose of the supporting information is to enable
% authors to provide and archive auxiliary information such as data
% tables, method information, figures, video, or computer software,
% in digital formats so that other scientists can use it.

% The key criteria are that the data:
% 1. supplement the main scientific conclusions of the paper but are not essential to the conclusions (with the exception of
%    including data so the experiment can be reproducible);
% 2. are likely to be usable or used by other scientists working in the field;
% 3. are described with sufficient precision that other scientists can understand them, and
% 4. are not exe files.
%

% All Supporting text and figures should be included in this document.

% Data sets, large tables, movie files,
% and audio files should be uploaded separately, following AGU naming
% conventions. Include their captions in this document and list the
% file name with the caption. You will be prompted to upload these
% files on the Upload Files tab during the submission process, using
% file type “Supporting Information (SI)”

     VPD is controlled to highlight the relationship with downwelling radiation, the reverse (controlling for radiation) is shown in Figure 7.
     For SMS (a,b), data are subdivided based on average soil matric potential, weighted by root fraction.
     For PHS (c,d), data are subdivided based on predawn (5h) root water potential.

     \includegraphics[width=30pc]{suppcond.pdf}
     \caption{(a,b) Log of conductance ($k_{s,r}$) versus soil potential for Soil Layer 5.
     (c,d) Log of hydraulic gradient ($\Delta\psi$) versus soil potential for Soil Layer 5.
     Note that the soil potential axes vary for PHS vs. SMS. 
     
     Multiplied together $k_{s,r}$ and $\Delta\psi$ yield the Layer-5 root water uptake.
     PHS conductance decreases by almost 3 orders of magnitude between 0 and -1MPa, which leads to reduced RWU, though this is offset (by about half) due to increases in $\Delta\psi$.
     
     
     while SMS $\Delta\psi$ decreases by less than 1 order of magnitude between 0 and -2MPa, 
     leading to higher sensitivity to soil potential with PHS, see Figure 10.
     
     Only midday (12h-14h, 2002-2003) timesteps are shown to emphasize the relationship with soil potential.
     With SMS, conductance is not modeled explicitly, but rather calculated as $k$=$q/\Delta\psi$ (see Section 2.4.2). 
     For soil potentials greater than or equal to 2.5MPa, $\Delta\psi$=0, and SMS implied conductance is undefined, but could probably be considered to equal 0.
     PHS conductance captures both root tissue and soil matrix resistances (operating in series).}

     Red lines mark the median, with boxes spanning the interquartile range.
     Bin widths are 0.25 MPa for SMS and 0.1 MPa for PHS.
     Soil Layer 5 is shown, because it is close enough to the surface (20 to 32 cm) to experience a significant range in soil potential, and it has a large root fraction (14.4\%, only Soil Layer 6 has a larger root fraction).
     Only midday (12h-14h) timesteps are used to highlight the relationship with soil potential.}
